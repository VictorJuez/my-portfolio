Nowadays I am finishing my studies as Erasmus student at Politecnico di Milano. Looking forward to do an internship next course year abroad. 

I am a Software Engineering student, love to keep improving my skills and learning new ones. 
I have already done an internship in my home university as a web developer and this year I'm doing project oriented courses like developing an Android app, 
a Unity video game and a Web Application. 

Really like team work, clean code and software architecture.

I am a Software Engineering student from Barcelona and currently I'm finishing my studies in an Erasmus+ exchange program at Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

Lately I have been focusing my career in full-stack web development field as I've seen it's what interests me the most, an internship as a web developer that I did in my
home university opened me this world and since then I realized that having the capacity to be aware of everything that is behind a complete web application is awesome.

Finally, I really like team work, clean code and software architecture.
